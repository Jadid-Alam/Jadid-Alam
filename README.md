## About Me

I'm currently studying for an MSc in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, with a predicted First Class (GPA: 4.0). My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming, Databases, Web Development, and Algorithms and Data Structures.

Before my Master's program, I spent one year studying MEng Chemical Engineering at the University of Oxford. During that time, I discovered my true passion for Computer Science, especially after I realized I enjoyed the computing labs much more than my core engineering classes. This experience improved my analytical and problem-solving skills and guided me toward programming and software development.

I have hands-on experience as a Web Developer and Software Developer at London Science College, where I worked on projects that boosted productivity and customer satisfaction. Additionally, as a Computer Science Tutor at FunTech, I helped students develop strong programming skills in a collaborative and engaging setting.

## My Projects

Throughout my studies and professional experiences, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, constantly honing my technical skills and improving my organizational abilities. Here are some of my projects:

* **VPS Server Hosting**: Hosted my portfolio and game backend myself on a VPS, ditching Vercel for complete control. Set up a secure Linux server with NGINX, UFW, and SSH hardening, tuned for 50+ concurrent users with 99.9% uptime since launch.
* **TradingAIForge**: Building a group project that enables users to create customized trading bots using various trading styles. It's all about simplicity and customization ease, with a goal of 80%+ user positive feedback.
* **1v1 Scrabble Game Backend**: Wrote a real-time multiplayer game backend in Rust and Web-Sockets, self-hosted on a rented Virtual Private Server. Resulted in 40% less response time than a Python implementation, providing ultra-low latency gameplay.
* **FDM Expense App**: Developed a full expense management application with React.js, Django, and MySQL to replace an Excel-based tracking system. Made processing of expenses claims 70% more efficient through the use of automated checks and structured approval processes.
* **LSC Homework Portal (commissioned)**: Created a JavaScript website to assist more than 100 teachers and students with their homework. Included a homework calendar to keep assignments organized.
* **LSC Invoice Builder (commissioned)**: Created an invoice creation program with JavaFX, simplifying billing for more than 500 repeat customers. Implemented a customer database, cutting data entry by hand by 80%.
* **Horse Race Simulator**: Developed a betting game in Java Swing, entertaining 100+ players with a virtual horse racing game. Incorporated an in-game currency system, facilitating player retention and engagement.
* **Personal Portfolio Website**: Developed and created my personal portfolio website, highlighting my projects and expertise, which has been visited by more than 50 viewers. Previously, I incorporated a MongoDB database for better project scalability and data handling. Used technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Django (Python), and MongoDB.
