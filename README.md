## About Me

I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, with a predicted 1st (GPA: 4.0). My studies have provided a strong foundation in key areas such as Object-Oriented Programming, Databases, Web Development, and Algorithms and Data Structures.

Prior to my Master's, I attempted an MEng in Chemical Engineering at the University of Oxford. This background has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills, which I now apply to Programming.

I have practical experience as a Web Developer and Software Developer at London Science College, where I contributed to improving productivity and customer satisfaction. I also have experience as a Computer Science Tutor at FunTech, where I helped students develop their programming skills.

## My Projects

Throughout my studies and professional experiences, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, constantly honing my technical skills and improving my organizational abilities. Here are some of my projects:

* **Horse Race Simulator**: Forged a betting game using Java Swing, engaging 100+ players with a simulated horse racing experience and implemented an in-game currency system, enhancing player retention and interaction.
* **Personal Portfolio Website**: Designed and established my personal portfolio website, showcasing my projects and skills, which has attracted over 50 visitors. It integrates a MongoDB database for improved project scalability and data management, and utilizes technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Django (Python), and MongoDB.
* **LSC Invoice Builder (commissioned)**: Built an invoice generation application using JavaFX, streamlining billing for over 500 recurring customers. This application integrated a customer database, reducing manual data entry by 80%.
* **LSC Homework Portal (commissioned)**: Developed a website using JavaScript to enhance homework management for over 100 students and teachers. This included implementing a homework calendar for efficient assignment tracking.
* **FDM Expense App**: Engineered a full-stack expense management system using React.js, Django, and MySQL, which replaced an Excel-based tracking system. This project improved expense claim processing efficiency by 70% through automated validation and structured approval workflows.
* **1v1 Scramble Game Backend**: Developed a real-time multiplayer game backend using Rust and Web-Sockets, hosted on AWS. Which achieved a 40% reduction in response time compared to a Python implementation, ensuring ultra-low latency gameplay
